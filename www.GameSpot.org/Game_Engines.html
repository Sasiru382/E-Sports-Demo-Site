		<h1 class="head">What are known as game engines?</h1>
		<p>A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games, and generally includes relevant libraries and support programs.The "engine" terminology is similar to the term "software engine" used in the software industry.</p>

		<p>Game engine can also refer to the development software utilizing this framework, typically offering a suite of tools and features for developing games.</p>

		<p>Developers can use game engines to construct games for video game consoles and other types of computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine may include a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics. Game engine implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, the same game engine to produce different games or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms.</p>

		<p>These game engines are sometimes called "middleware" because, as with the business sense of the term, they provide a flexible and reusable software platform which provides all the core functionality needed, right out of the box, to develop a game application while reducing costs, complexities, and time-to-market â€” all critical factors in the highly competitive video-game industry. Game engines usually provide platform abstraction, allowing the same game to run on various platforms (including game consoles and personal computers) with few, if any, changes made to the game source-code. </p>

		<p>Before game engines, games were typically written as singular entities.As game engine technology matures and becomes more user-friendly, the application of game engines has broadened in scope. They are now being used for serious games: visualization, training, medical, and military simulation applications, with the CryEngine being one example.To facilitate this accessibility, new hardware platforms are now being targeted by game engines, including mobile phones (e.g. Android phones, iPhone) and web browsers (e.g. WebGL, Shockwave, Flash, Trinigy's WebVision, Silverlight, Unity Web Player, O3D and pure DHTML).</p>

		<p>As technology ages, the components of an engine may become outdated or insufficient for the requirements of a given project. Since the complexity of programming an entirely new engine may result in unwanted delays (or necessitate that a project restart from the beginning), an engine-development team may elect to update their existing engine with newer functionality or components.</p>

        <p>
            Unreal Engine (UE) is a 3D computer graphics game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter game Unreal. Initially developed for PC first-person shooters, it has since been used in a variety of genres of games and has seen adoption by other industries, most notably the film and television industry. Written in C++, the Unreal Engine features a high degree of portability, supporting a wide range of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms.
            The latest generation, Unreal Engine 5, was launched in April 2022. As its predecessor released in March 2014, its source code is available on GitHub after registering an account, and commercial use is granted based on a royalty model. Epic waives their royalties margin for games until developers have earned US$1 million in revenue and the fee is waived if developers publish on the Epic Games Store. Epic has included features from acquired companies like Quixel in the engine, which is seen as helped by Fortnite's revenue.

                'The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience' is a free, boundary-pushing cinematic and open-world interactive tech demo that combines the power of PlayStationÂ®5 with UE5.An original concept written and cinematically directed by Lana Wachowski and James McTeigue, this boundary-pushing technical demo features Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising their roles as Neo and Trinity while alsoâ€”in a blending of the real and unrealâ€”playing themselves.Many of the VFX crew from the original film came back together for the digital execution of the experience, including John Gaeta, Kim Libreri, Jerome Platteaux, George Borshukov, and Michael Gay, in collaboration with teams across both Epic Games and partners such as SideFX, Evil Eye Pictures, WetaFX (formerly Weta Digital), and many others.The demo morphs from breathtakingly realistic cinematic to fast-paced third-person shooter experience, complete with action-packed car chase sequence, and also provides a rich, vastly detailed open world to explore, set within the universe of 'The Matrix'.

        <p>
            CryEngine is a game engine designed by the German game developer Crytek. It has been used in all of their titles with the initial version being used in Far Cry, and continues to be updated to support new consoles and hardware for their games The CryEngine software development kit (SDK), originally called Sandbox Editor, is the current version of the level editor used to create levels for CryEngine by Crytek. Tools are also provided within the software to facilitate scripting, animation, and object creation. It has been included with various Crytek games (including, but not limited to, Crysis and Far Cry), and is used extensively for modding purposes. The editing style is that of the sandbox concept, with the emphasis on large terrains and a free style of mission programming. The editor can also construct indoor settings.

			<h3>What is Unity?</h3>
			<p>Unity is so much more than the worldâ€™s best real-time development platform â€“ itâ€™s also a robust ecosystem designed to enable your success.

			Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development.
			The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, construction, and the United States Armed Forces</p>
